First thing I want you to build me is a simple todo list app. Using HTML/CSS and vanilla JavaScript.

It should have the following functionality:

- Display tasks in a list
- Add a task
- Mark a task as complete
- Delete a single task
- Delete all tasks

The tasks don't need to be stored anywhere, besides in the HTML initially, but we'll expand on a few of the concepts in this to turn it into a fully featured application.

Future concepts (version 2.0)

- Re-ordering of tasks
- Persistent storage of tasks 

More future functionality
- ES6 (transpilation)
- SCSS
- Build tools (gulp, grunt, webpack)
- Frameworks (jQuery, vue, react)
